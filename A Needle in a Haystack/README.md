# A needle in a Haystack

***Leo is blindfolded and has to find a needle in a haystack. In the haystack there are 10^{100} straws and 1 needle (yes it's a pretty huge haystack :)). The needle is stuck in between straws and in order to get it all straws must be removed from the haystack first.
At every turn, Leo can randomly pick one straw and remove it.
The task looks impossible, so Angelo is going to give him a little help. Every straw is labelled with a number from 1 to $10^{100}$. If Leo picks a straw, Angelo is going to remove it from the haystack along with all the straws labelled with a bigger number. So if at the first turn Leo picks the straw number 123456, at then next turn the haystack will contain all straws from 1 to 123455. On average how many turns it will take Leo to remove all straws and find the needle?***


We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution. You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
