# King's Arthur Round Table
Angelo and Leonardo have been invited to King’s Arthur Round Table in Camelot Castle. Arthur asks them to use his sword (the legendary Sword in the Stone indeed) to draw two chords across the table. 

**What is the probability that these two chords intercept each other?**

We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution.
You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
