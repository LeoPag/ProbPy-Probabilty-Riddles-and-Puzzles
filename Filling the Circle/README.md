# Filling the Circle

#### You have to uniformly fill a circle of radius R with N 2D points. You are provided with a uniform sampler U(0,1). Devise a strategy to achieve the task.

We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution. You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
