# The Penalty Shoot-out Problem

In this folder, you can find a probability problem about football.
Consider a classic penalty shootout in football (or soccer if you are from the States).
Penalty shoot-out is used in football to break a tie. Both teams first kick 5 penalties each. If the score is still tied, the shoot-out continues each penalty at a time until one of the teams gets an advantage.

The question we're asking is the following:

**1) Let us define the probability of scoring a penalty as $p$. What is the expected number of penalty turns in a shoot-out?**


We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution.
You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
