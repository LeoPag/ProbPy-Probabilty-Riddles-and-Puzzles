# How long can you make it?
You are invited to play a game. You will be repeatedly extracting values from a uniform distribution *U*(0, 1). You keep drawing as long as the sequence you are getting is monotonically increasing. You win an amount of money which equals the length of the sequence (excluding the last value which breaks the monotonicity). How much should you pay to play the game?

We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution. You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer
