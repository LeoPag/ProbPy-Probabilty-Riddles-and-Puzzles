# The First Ace
You shuffle an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards containing 4 aces. From the top, you turn up cards until the first ace appears. We ask you two questions:

1) On average, how many cards are required to see the first ace?

2) If you have to bet on this number once, what would you bet?

We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution.
You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
