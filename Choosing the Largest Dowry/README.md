# Choosing the Largest Dowry

#### The king, to test Leonardo, a candidate for the position of wise man, offers him a chance to marry the young lady in the court with the largest dowry. The amounts of dowries are written on slips of paper and mixed. A slip is drawn at random and Leonardo must decide whether that is the largest dowry or not. If he decides it is, he gets the lady and her dowry if he is correct; otherwise, he gets nothing. 
#### If Leonardo decides against the amount written on the first slip, he must choose or refuse the next slip, and so on until he chooses one, or else the slips are exhausted.
#### In all, 100 attractive young ladies participate, each with a different dowry. How should Leonardo make his decision?
