# Correlated Gaussians

#### You are only equipped with a uniform sampler U(0,1), and with our beloved standard normal table .Devise a strategy to build two standard gaussian random variables  $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, such that their correlation coefficient $\rho_{xy} = \rho$.

We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution. You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
