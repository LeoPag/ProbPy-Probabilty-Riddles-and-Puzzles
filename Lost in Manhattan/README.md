# Lost in Manhattan

Angelo and Leonardo are out on a trip in New York City. However, after a few hours they are already struggling with Manhattan grid pattern and they get lost. Leonardo is just coming out of a trip from Rockefeller center and is now located at the intersection between 5th Avenue and 47th Street. Angelo instead happens to be a little be more downtown west at the intersection between 9th Avenue and 43th Street. Can you help them find their way?
In particular, we ask you 3 questions.


**1. How many possible shortest routes does Angelo have to reach Leonardo?**


Let’s assume Angelo and Leonardo start moving towards each other at the same time. We can also assume that they walk at the same speed. Of course Angelo is only moving north and east, while Leo only goes south and west.


**2. What is the probability that thy bump into each other at Times Square (7th Avenue, 45th Street)?**

**3. What is the probability that they happen to bump into each other?**
