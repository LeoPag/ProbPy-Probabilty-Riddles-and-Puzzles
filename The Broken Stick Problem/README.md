In this folder, you can find a classic probability problem involving probability and triangles.
We will go over two variants of this problem, involving two different procedures of cuts.

The questions we're asking are very simple:

1.     Assume you take a stick of length 1 and you break it uniformly at random into three parts. What is the probability that the three pieces can be used to form a triangle?

2.     Assume you take a stick of length 1 and you break it into three parts, following this procedure:
    - First, you break the stick into two pieces uniformly at random. The left part of the stick constitutes the first side of the triangle
    -  Then you break the remaining part of the stick into two pieces again uniformly at random.
     What is the probability that the three pieces can be used to form a triangle?


We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution.
You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
