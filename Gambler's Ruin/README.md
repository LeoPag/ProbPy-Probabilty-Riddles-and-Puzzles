# The Gambler's Ruin Problem

In this folder, you can find a classic probability problem involving Markov chains.

The question is the following:

**1) Angelo has 1$ and Leonardo has 2$. They decide to play a game against each other. At each turn of the game, the losers gives the winner 1\$. Angelo is a stronger player than Leonardo and wins each turn with probability 2/3. The game ends when one of the player goes bankrupt. What is the probability that Angelo wins the game?**

We really encourage you to have a go at the problem before looking at the solution.
You can find both the analytical solution and some simulations in Python code to verify the accuracy of our answer.
